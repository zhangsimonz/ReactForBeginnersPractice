# ReactForBeginnersPractice
======
This repo is to store the coding practice of an online course provided by [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com/), the final product is an online shopping web application. Course site is [here](https://reactforbeginners.com/), so far, I found it is a very good introductory course for React and I'm really enjoying it.

Hopefully this course will help me get a clear understanding of React.js and open the door of Front-End Development for me, one of my most successful friends in front end development field suggest learning React.js as it is light weight and fast although not too easy to start, he adviced me that React is the future.

It's time to get my hands dirty!
